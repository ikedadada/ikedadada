# Hi, I'm Koichi Ikeda

Full-stack engineer (ex-ML), currently backend-leaning. I like small, sharp systems.
Primary languages: Go, TypeScript. Also use: Python, Java. Learning Rust.

I care about separation of responsibilities (DDD / Clean Architecture),
and I’m interested in native networking and security (e.g., Websocket, mTLS, circuits).

## Tech Focus
Go • TypeScript • Python • Java • Next.js • AWS • Docker • Kubernetes

## Selected Projects
- **Axiom Shift** — PvE strategy prototype aiming for a “new run, new rules” experience:
  the ruleset changes on each launch. Go + Ebiten; domain/usecase/ui kept separate.  
  https://github.com/ikedadada/axiom-shift

- **iko-game-app-frontend** — Next.js (TypeScript) frontend for a browser online game,
  using WebSocket-based real-time communication.  
  https://github.com/ikedadada/iko-game-app-frontend

- **iko-game-app-backend** — TypeScript backend for the same game:
  WebSocket endpoints + simple state management; containerized.  
  https://github.com/ikedadada/iko-game-app-backend

- **molecule-playground** — SPA app using React Router to avoid complex Next.js upgrade paths;
  additionally experimented with in-browser 3D rendering.  (see https://ikedadada.github.io/molecule-playground/.)

- **go-ptor** — WIP pseudo-Tor (pTor) in Go; exploring circuit building and multi-hop routing.  
  https://github.com/ikedadada/go-ptor

## What I value
- Clear boundaries (domain / usecase / infra) and typed, boring interfaces
- Simple data models over clever ones
- Observability and graceful shutdown before features

## Currently
- Building a browser party game over WebSocket
- Experimenting with circuit routing and mTLS-backed services
